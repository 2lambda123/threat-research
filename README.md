## üõ†Ô∏è The Online Operations Killchain
To help the broader research community to study and protect people across different internet services, we‚Äôve collated and organized these indicators according to the Online Operations Kill Chain framework, which we use at Meta to analyze many sorts of malicious online operations, identify the earliest opportunities to disrupt them, and share information across investigative teams. The kill chain describes the sequence of steps that threat actors go through to establish a presence across the internet, disguise their operations, engage with potential audiences, and respond to takedowns. 

This section includes the latest threat indicators and is not meant to provide a full cross-internet, historic view into these operations. It‚Äôs important to note that, in our assessment, the mere sharing of these operations‚Äô links or engaging with them by online users would be insufficient to attribute accounts to a given campaign without corroborating evidence.
